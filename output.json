    "markdown": "Kingdom thinking demands that we recognise the need for the empowerment of God. \n \n\n#### Verses\n\nKingdom thinking demands that we recognize the need for the empowerment of God. As believers, we can find encouragement and guidance in various Bible verses that speak to the topic of relying on God's power and seeking His empowerment.\n\nOne such verse is [Proverbs 3:5-6](https://mem.ai/m/CTZb7DCyUZD67wzk4CCa)\n, which reminds us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our own understanding. By acknowledging God's ways as higher and better than our own, we open ourselves up to His empowerment and guidance.\n\nAnother verse that speaks to the need for God's empowerment is Jeremiah 29:11. This verse reassures us that God has plans to prosper us and give us hope and a future. When we trust in His plans and rely on His empowerment, we can confidently move forward in our journey.\n\nRomans 8:31-39 is another powerful passage that reminds us of God's empowering presence in our lives. It declares that if God is for us, no one can be against us. It highlights how God, who gave His Son for us, will graciously give us all things and justify us. It assures us that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ, even in the face of trouble, hardship, or persecution.\n\n#### Key Point\n\nBy meditating on these verses and seeking God's empowerment through prayer and faith, we can embrace kingdom thinking and experience the fullness of His power in our lives.\n",

    "markdown": "We must let go and remove the encumbrances in our lives to follow after wealth.\n \n\n#### Verses\n\nHere are some verses from the NIV Bible that talk about the importance of letting go of encumbrances and following after wealth:\n1. Matthew 6:19-21 - \"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\"\n2. Proverbs 3:9-10 - \"Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.\"\n3. Malachi 3:10 - \"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,\u201d says the Lord Almighty, \u201cand see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.\"\n4. Luke 6:38 - \"Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\"\n\n#### Key Point\n\nThese verses highlight the importance of honoring God with our wealth, giving generously, and storing up treasures in heaven rather than earthly possessions. They remind us that when we let go of worldly encumbrances and prioritize God's kingdom, He will bless us abundantly and provide for our needs.\n",

Matthew 28:19-20 - \"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of spreading the message of hope to all nations and the assurance of Jesus' presence in this mission.\n2. Mark 16:15 - \"He said to them, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.'\" This verse is another call to share the message of hope with the entire world, emphasizing the universality of the gospel.\n3. 1 Peter 3:15 - \"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.\" This verse encourages believers to be ready to share the reason for their hope when asked, doing so with gentleness and respect.\n4. Romans 10:14-15 - \"How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!'\" This passage emphasizes the importance of sharing the message of hope with others, as it is through hearing the gospel that people can come to believe in Jesus.\n\n#### Key Point\n\nBy sharing these verses and others like them, we can inspire others with the message of hope and the impact it can have on their lives.\n",

    "markdown": "See Isaiah 49:2, there is a pattern here, this is how God works! It is in the hidden season that He polishes us for His destiny. \n\n\nHe made my mouth like a sharpened sword,\n    in the shadow of his hand he hid me;\nhe made me into a polished arrow\n    and concealed me in his quiver.\n\n### Key Summary\nThe passage from Isaiah 49:2 describes a metaphorical process of refinement and preparation for a divine purpose. The speaker describes being shaped and honed like a weapon, first as a sword and then as an arrow, in the hidden or shadowy season. This process is likened to being hidden away in a quiver, waiting for the moment when the arrow will be released and sent forth on its intended trajectory.\n\nThis metaphor can be understood as a representation of the way that God works in the lives of believers. Just as the arrow is carefully crafted and prepared for a specific purpose, so too are we shaped and molded for a divine destiny. This process may involve difficult or challenging seasons, but ultimately it is intended to bring about a greater good.\n\nThe passage also highlights the importance of patience and trust in the midst of uncertainty. Just as the arrow must wait in the quiver until the archer is ready to release it, so too must we learn to wait on God's timing and trust in His plan for our lives. In this way, the passage offers a message of hope and encouragement to those who may be struggling to understand their own purpose or path in life.\n",

    "markdown": "The power of one thing generates power and clarity, with a singular purpose, there is concentrated power! \n\n\n### Verses\n\nThe concept of the power of one is a recurring theme in the Bible. \n\nIn Matthew 6:24, Jesus teaches that no one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. \n\nSimilarly, in Revelation 3:15-16, Jesus tells the church in Laodicea that they are neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm, and that because they are neither one nor the other, he will spit them out of his mouth.\n\nThe idea of concentrated power is also present in the Bible. In Philippians 3:13-14, Paul writes that he forgets what lies behind and strains forward to what lies ahead, pressing on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. \n\nSimilarly, in Hebrews 12:1-2, the author urges the readers to lay aside every weight and sin that clings so closely and to run with perseverance the race that is set before them, looking to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of their faith.\n\n### Key Summary\n\nTherefore, we can see that the power of one thing generating power and clarity with a singular purpose is consistent with the teachings of the Bible. As we focus on one thing and strive towards a singular purpose, we can generate concentrated power and clarity, just as Jesus and Paul urge us to do in their teachings.\n### \n###\n",

However, as [Hebrews 11:1](https://mem.ai/m/KPfiaimgbR6iyfJqtiCM)\nreminds us, \"faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.\" We can trust that God has a plan for our lives, even when we cannot see it, and that He is working all things together for our good ([Romans 8:28](https://mem.ai/m/2QzeRSOljAcjbXYxieBm)\n).\n\n[Proverbs 3:5-6](https://mem.ai/m/CTZb7DCyUZD67wzk4CCa)\nencourages us to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our own understanding, acknowledging that God's ways are higher and better than our own. Similarly, [Jeremiah 29:11](https://mem.ai/m/MmTgWIQo1iSnHcBqcn7h)\nreminds us that God has plans to prosper us and give us hope and a future.\n\nWhen we maintain our faith in God, even in the midst of failures and difficult circumstances, we can be confident that He is with us and working on our behalf. As Psalm 37:23-24 says, \"The Lord makes firm the steps of the one who delights in him; though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.\"\n",

To hit the mark. \n \n\n#### Verses\n\nThe quote above emphasizes the importance of being sharp and directional, like an arrow, in order to hit the mark. This concept is echoed in several verses in the Bible, including Psalm 127:3-5 which states, \"Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one\u2019s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.\"\n\nThis verse compares children to arrows in the hands of a warrior, highlighting their importance and potential in the world. Just as a warrior must aim and shoot their arrows with precision in order to hit their target, parents must guide and direct their children in a way that allows them to fulfill their potential and achieve their goals.\n\nAnother relevant verse is Proverbs 22:6 which states, \"Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of teaching children the right way from a young age, in order to set them on a path towards success and fulfillment.\n\n#### Key Summary\n\nOverall, these verses remind us of the importance of raising children who are sharp and directional, and who have the potential to hit the mark in all areas of their lives.\n",

    "markdown": "### If there is no God, everything is permitted - Fyodor Dostoevsky.\n \n\n### Verses\n\nWhile the NIV Bible does not have a direct verse that corresponds to the quote \"If there is no God, everything is permitted,\" there are several verses that speak to the idea of morality and the importance of belief in God.\n\nIn Romans 1:18-20, it says, \"The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God\u2019s invisible qualities\u2014his eternal power and divine nature\u2014have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.\"\n\nThis verse underscores the idea that belief in God is essential to understanding the nature of reality and morality. Without belief in God, we are left to our own devices and cannot fully understand the consequences of our actions.\n\nAdditionally, Psalm 14:1 says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.' They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.\" This verse highlights the idea that belief in God is necessary for living a morally upright life.\n\n### Keu Summary\n\nOverall, while there is no direct verse that corresponds to the quote from Fyodor Dostoevsky, there are several verses that speak to the importance of belief in God in understanding morality and living a righteous life.\n",

Mercy is not getting what we deserve. Grace is getting what we do not deserve. God\u2019s grace is His gift for us, what we don\u2019t deserve. We are to focus on the gaze of God\u2019s grace. All of us have received an abundance of God\u2019s grace. Psalms 145:8-9, who is God good to? He is good to all as God\u2019s grace is poured out on all <- Matt 5:45. So why does God give us grace? Which words describe the character of God? God\u2019s grace restraints evil on this world. He is patient wanting everyone to come to repentance. God\u2019s grace draws us to salvation. We tend to gravitate to sin, this is known as the total depravity of man. Depravity describes that we are unable to save ourselves, Rom 10:3-12. We are dead in sin and dead people are unable to respond. So we can only come to salvation by the grace of God, through the person and work of Jesus, John 12:32., John 1:9. Something cosmic took place at the cross. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpegaa362d49-b120-4e99-ac3e-b5ed27e21a12)\n\n2. John 1:9, there is an offer of universal salvation. It is not true that God called only some from sin, He did it for all. There is an enabling grace that offers us to accept salvation. The sovereignty of God does not violate the freedom of choice and free will. God\u2019s grace has declared us as righteous in Jesus. Rom 3:22-24.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg3ba91144-67c2-483b-acd2-1f98b6de98dc)\n\n3. Justifying grace, can it be earned? No. Can we pay for it? No. It\u2019s free, Jesus has already paid the price for this grace. It is a gift, it cannot be earned. We live in a performance driven world, where we have to prove our worth, earn our achievements. When people say we are not good enough, the Bible teaches us that having Jesus is enough. We ought to share this grace with others, that should be our response. Sometimes we fall into a performance driven Christianity - we enter by grace, but we have to work towards earning God\u2019s favour. This is not true. It\u2019s not because we were good, but because we are His. We become part of God\u2019s family by grace. Legalism is a lie. We are sons and daughters of the most High, we are saved by grace and by grace alone. God\u2019s grace shapes us into Christlikeness. 2 Cor 3:18, we are being transformed into His image. \n\n4. Most of us see the pandemic as a problem and a trial, maybe it is a test. God is using the situation to shape the church and shake the church, where do we place our trust? He uses the situation to lay bare what the situation in our heart is like? He is testing to see if we are committed to be a church. God\u2019s priority is not our convenience or our comfort, but our likeness of Jesus Christ; all of that is the work of God\u2019s grace in our life.  \n\n5. God\u2019s grace sustains us through our trials. Sustaining grace of God. \n\n6. God\u2019s grace manifests in service to one another. We have different gifts to the grace given to each of us. There is a word play in Greek, not evident in English. Charismata - gifts, Charis - grace. Gifts in greek is the manifestation of grace. When we exercise the gift of teaching, it is a manifestation of grace and edifies others. We manifest the grace, we don\u2019t just get grace, we give grace, this is called serving grace. If we have a gift from God, we get, now we must give. \n\n7. This is the summary of the sermon:  \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Common%20grace.jpeg09d3ba4d-8252-4e74-8ab3-cc5e726458a5)\n\n\n8.

We don\u2019t have to meet any standard in order to catch God\u2019s attention. \n\n\n#### Most Meaningful Statement\n\n1.

Joseph is son number 11. The story of Joseph begins with this account in Gen 37. Most of the other sons were already late twenties, Joseph was 17. \n\n2. Joseph's assignment was to watch over the brothers. The Joseph anointing begins with the concept of favour. Joseph has the favour of Jacob. A strong Joseph anointing will be released on us, and the first element of this is the special favour of God. There is a special bond between father and son.\n\n3. The second element is that of leadership. The Joseph anointing is the anointing of leadership - to establish the kingdom of God. \n\n4. When you are favored by God and placed into leadership there will be jealously. \n\n5. Gen 39:21-23 we see God showed Joseph mercy and kindness. Not only do we have favour and the anointing of leadership, but we have the mercy of God. Sometimes even though we have the anointing, we find ourselves in the prison of life. Time seems to past slowly, we feel lost. \n\n6. But 2014 is the year of acceleration and momentum. In Joseph's case when he was in prison there came suddenly a momentum which broke him out of prison. This acceleration will come swiftly.\n\n7. Joseph is special because he is the son of Rachel, the one whom Jacob really loved. Technically he was the \"first born\".\n\n8. The Joseph anointing is the anointing of stewardship, he was the greatest steward in the Bible. I was just praying that I was a very very poor steward. \n\n#### Most Meaningful Statement \n\n1. When you are favored by God and placed into leadership there will be jealously.  \n\n2.The Joseph anointing is the anointing of stewardship, he was the greatest steward in the Bible.  d\n\n3. The Joseph anointing begins with the concept of favour.  #shared\n\n#### Thoughts \n\n\n#### Prayer Response\n\n\n#### What God wants me to do in response to this\n",

    "markdown": "### **Main Service (**[Dominic Yeo](https://mem.ai/m/NlX3XRdR7W10uOq6haQT)\n) on 19 Feb 2022\n\n### Pastor\n[Dominic Yeo](https://mem.ai/m/NlX3XRdR7W10uOq6haQT)\n\n\n### Verse\n\n[1 Kings 17:10-15](https://mem.ai/m/kEx8KS9ilQ6dIgpOIBNO)\n\n\n### Title\n\nRestoration Key - a master key. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg534aad87-f8fc-4728-b9f9-b69ce828a986)\n### Message\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg19af2da3-5e06-4125-a170-eeed8136110b)\n\n1. The master key is the key of giving. See 1 Kings 17:10-15, tells us about this. She is like a beggar who depends on the generosity of people. She is at the extreme point of life, in the midst of this story we see the master key at work. God promotes us to the higher state. So that we can be blessed by the Lord to bless others. This has to be the master key of heavy, giving is the motif of heaven, this giving. In the same way, God gave His only son and Jesus gave of His very own life. Giving is the motif of heaven. There are three points. \n\n2. Point #1. The willingness to give will always trigger the gifts of God (1 King 17:11). There was famine and drought. This woman has a willing heart. In such harsh times, there is a willingness to give water in this hard times. The willingness to give is an indication of genoursity of heart, God was not looking at her ability to give. IF we want to give God will enable us, begin with the willingness of heart. Giving is the response of the heart. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/WILLINGNESS.jpege5f29aba-b99f-4f5f-ad42-b0393c9c8b13)\n\n\n3. IF you want to see blessings in your life, begin with willingness.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpege8bd63fc-afe7-427c-8594-1f7033c1772e)\n\n4. Point #2. Giving that costs you something always attack God to you.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/GIVING%20THAT%20COSTS%20YOU%20SOMETHING.jpeg61579aad-ade2-4632-9c87-1503ab9cf02e)\n\n\n5. She begins with the heart of willingness, but when Elijah pushes her more, this touches a certain point in her life. Now you move to a survival point. We are provoked to this point, it costs. This drew the attention of God, sacrificial giving is faith in God. She knows this is a choice between her child and the prophet of God. This is where God draws her to a place of endless supply. Giving when you are in the place of need is a manifestation of faith. Heb 6:11, heaven is attracted to this lady. When we give sacrificially God gives. Mark 12:41-44 tells the story of another widow, Jesus was also attracted to this widow. Very similar story, giving of your all always attracts God to you. Real giving creates the melody of heavy. IT was true giving from her heart. Do this if you want to see the true restoration of God. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg1023b73b-69ed-4fe0-a0b0-4d09c8bffd6f)\n\n6. God is attracted to faith. People who gives without expectation will see God\u2019s miracles. This is true giving, giving without the motivation of returns. \n\n7. Point #3. It is not giving what you wish.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/GIVING%20WHAT.jpeg6a889719-9b85-496a-b8ea-7398f55f3ae8)\n\n\n8. Every day she was blessed. Every moment of the day there was food for the moment and her family. Her whole network was blessed by her. Giving to God first is what it is all about. We must put God first in our life, sometimes we allow our needs to be first. God must be on the pedestal of our life. This completes the miracle, If we give God with our we have have, God will bless you with what do not have. It is about total giving, like the widow\u2019s mite. Then the miracles happen. Total giving completes God\u2019s miracles. God will not owe you, He will always repay you. \n\n### Most Meaningful Statement \n\n1. The master key is the key of giving.  \n2. God promotes us to the higher state. So that we can be blessed by the Lord to bless others.  \n3. In the same way, God gave His only son and Jesus gave of His very own life. Giving is the motif of heaven. \n4. The willingness to give will always trigger the gifts of God. \n\n\n### Thoughts\n\n\n### Prayer Response\n\n\n### What God wants me to do in response to this:\n",

    "markdown": "### **Main Service (**[Wendy Ong](https://mem.ai/m/KNmK3pB8EyLcdsGsQ3vC)\n) on 15 Jan 2022\n\nPastor:: [Wendy Ong](https://mem.ai/m/KNmK3pB8EyLcdsGsQ3vC)\n\n\nVerse\nEsther\n\nTitle: \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/INSTRUMENTS.jpeg0235e662-9648-466e-a2dd-b8aa670a1d99)\n\n\nLesson: \n\n1. She talked about Spider-Man and how his identify was exposed and it messed up his university admission. \n\n2. She now talked about the invisible God who does a lot of works and no one notices. She gave a brief overview of the book of Esther. This and Song of Songs do not mention God, but His actions are clearly seen. Many people preached about the role of Esther, today she wants to talk about the invisible main character in the story, God Himself. Mordecai was the invisible hand of the invisible God. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Hand%20of.jpege9755734-d980-4940-a9d3-9385add4a33b)\n\n\n3. God gave her a lot of favour in order to set her into a position of influence.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Hand%20of.jpeg08491807-5c8f-4864-afe0-dcfac19c6a6b)\n\n\n4.  Mordecai and Esther were positioned by God to have favour in the King\u2019s eyes. God\u2019s divine orchestration turned the situation from a calamity to a time of celebration. God works through visible vessels and instruments. \n\n5. How can we become instruments of honour in hostile environments? We could be facing big challenges, yet God is at work in our environment and He will use us as visible instruments of honours. Three character traits of God\u2019s people. Charity = Agape, love for a fellow brother. Charity is the highest form of Christian love, an unselfish love filled with kindness. Mordecai cared for Esther selflessly. Everyday he walked back and forth at the courtyard because he cared for Esther. \n\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/CHARITY.jpeg24eb501e-a3c2-48d2-82fe-2cee3fd8194a)\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/CHARITY.jpeg697eab39-0919-495c-a056-16887a72c89d)\n\n\n6. Haman on the other hand does not carry a spirit of charity. But he carried a spirit of arrogant. If carry the spirit of arrogance and greed we will not be well. Mordecai is like Jesus. The Lord promoted and raised Mordecai. This was recorded in the Persian history.  \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Mordecal%20Honored.jpegcbea3632-a968-436f-97d8-77986150cfe9)\n\n\n7. When you don\u2019t seek honour and glory, God will bring those to us.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpegd472e446-e866-4ea0-9d6f-4329bf6d2b30)\n\n\n8. The next character trait of God\u2019s leader. Interesting: Mordecai was a descendant of King Saul, and Hamaan was a descendant of Agag. That\u2019s one reason why Mordecai did not bow down to Hamaan. People today need to see the courage of God\u2019s people in the midst of turmoil during this time of pandemic. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/COURAGE.jpeg75154cde-25d5-4d41-9b5f-1b72988239f5)\n\n\n9 .Deliverance for the Jews will arise for another place if Esther remains silent. God will provide for His people and His missions work, we must arise and grab hold of God\u2019s destiny for our family; otherwise that help will arise from another. Let God use us to bring confidence to people around us. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/CONFIDENCE.jpegc1be0700-de78-474f-bcf6-f0b117853158)\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/The%20Master%20was%20searching.jpega5337017-06cb-4c71-b643-f39811d68ca0)\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg6968d8cc-2c5a-4be9-b674-96d778a46e7e)\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg1b779a88-b6c2-4068-ba20-ca9c9193240d)\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg0d556c7e-8c2b-4918-ab0f-e57bb11b8927)\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/memvp-25499.appspot.com/images/Image.jpeg97af44de-ff77-4ecc-8584-759c10af48dd)\n\nMost Meaningful Statement : \n\n\n\nThoughts : \n\n1.
